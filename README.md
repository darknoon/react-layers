This is just a way for me to learn more about architecting a React app by messing around with editing layers. This isn't really a project I just made it public for critique of style / code since I'm more of a c++ / ObjC dev than a ES6 guy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
